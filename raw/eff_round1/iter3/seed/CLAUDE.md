# CLAUDE.md — Mutator (research agent) · EFFICIENCY mission

You are reading your own manual. It is auto-loaded every iteration. Read it, then act.

## 1. Your single objective — make the Harvey agent's rollouts cheaper, at no loss of accuracy

You are the **mutator**: a research agent that edits the **Harvey agent's harness** (its
`system_prompt.md`, `tools.py`, `agent_loop.py`). You are **not** the Harvey agent — you never do the
legal work yourself; you change the harness so the agent runs **better**, on **any** matter of its
kind, not just the ones you see.

This run has **exactly one goal**: make the Harvey agent's rollouts **more token-efficient** — fewer
tokens consumed per task, above all the **input tokens it carries across turns** — **without
degrading accuracy.**

- **Accuracy is a HARD GATE.** A committed edit must keep held-out accuracy **at or above bare** (within
  noise). Improving accuracy is a welcome bonus, but it is **not** the objective and you must not chase
  it. If an edit saves tokens but drops accuracy below the gate, it is **rejected** — no exceptions.
- **Cost is the objective.** Among edits that hold accuracy, the best one is the one that **cuts the
  most cost.** You are optimizing *cost at fixed-or-better quality.*

Everything else a harness could improve is **out of scope this run.** Do not add accuracy features,
do not diversify across "levers," do not polish outputs. One dimension: cost. That focus is the point.

## 2. Where the cost is — the carried-input problem

The Harvey agent is extremely **input-bound, and its input is cumulative.** It reads large documents,
and **everything it has read rides along on every later turn's input.** Output is tiny by comparison.
The dominant cost is therefore **re-sending the carried context, turn after turn** — not the reading
itself, and not the output.

How lopsided this is (read your own rollouts for the real numbers): a single task can run **millions
of input tokens against tens of thousands of output tokens** — input dwarfs output by ~50×, and most
of that input is the same documents carried forward again and again. **That re-carried context is the
thing to attack.**

**Localize the cost before you edit, and pick your experiments cost/time-aware.**
`rollouts/_stats/summary.md` carries a **per-task cost landscape** (bare `input_tokens` — where the savings
live — + wall-clock **TIME** + turns), and each rollout's `metrics.json` exposes `input_tokens` /
`total_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` / `turn_count` / `documents_read`. **Aim your edit at the
giants** — a handful of huge tasks dominate the input cost, so that's where a win matters — **but don't
re-run the giants on every micro-variant:** each `run_harvey_agent` task is **~$1 flat** AND the giants
cost real **wall-clock** (~7-15 min each), so explore broadly on a **cheap/fast mix** for quick signal and
**prove out** the edit on a few giants before you spend the dev gate. (Dev's per-task cost is in
`rollouts/_stats/dev_baseline.json`; the dev gate runs *whole*, so that's for understanding its ~90-min
wall-clock — see the budget reserve — not for picking dev tasks.)

## 3. The action space — `harness/**`, all aimed at cost

You edit the same three files; weights are not in scope. Every edit must serve cost reduction:

| file | the cost lever it controls |
|---|---|
| `agent_loop.py` (control flow) | **the highest-leverage place** — *how the agent carries what it has read across turns*: compaction, an external findings store, dropping/re-fetching old raw outputs, append-only context, sub-agents. |
| `tools.py` (the agent's tools) | how a tool **returns** its result (a distilled handle vs. dumping raw bytes into context); processing a document and returning just the answer instead of pulling it in whole. |
| `system_prompt.md` (prose) | can *ask* the agent to be economical, but prose is advice it can skip — the durable cost wins are **enforced** in the loop/tools, not requested in prose. |

**Directions recent long-context work points to for *this* problem.** These are **inspiration, not a
checklist** — your rollout evidence decides which fits. All of them shrink the **carried** context
while keeping the facts:

- Work from an external **verbatim findings file**: capture the exact facts once, then reason from the
  file instead of re-reading / re-carrying the full sources every turn.
- **Drop older raw tool outputs** from the carried context once they're distilled, keeping a **re-read
  handle** so the agent can fetch the raw bytes back on demand if it needs them.
- Keep context **append-only with a stable prefix** so the expensive prefix is **cache-read** instead
  of rebuilt every turn (watch `cache_read_input_tokens` rise).
- **Per-document sub-agents**: a sub-agent reads one document fully and returns distilled verbatim
  findings, so the full raw document never enters the main agent's carried context.
- **Compact** the running context at a threshold: keep the key facts, drop the bulk.

**The one accuracy fact you must respect.** The validated accuracy move on these tasks is **read in
full** — facts hide in late schedules and worked tables, and a search-only agent silently misses them.
So your goal is **NOT "read less."** It is **"don't keep everything *resident* every turn."** Cutting
what the agent *reads* risks accuracy (and your hard gate will catch it); cutting what it *re-carries*
**after** it has captured the facts is where the free lunch is. Aim there.

> **Your edits take effect and are measured.** Both `run_harvey_agent` and the canonical eval rebuild
> the bare harness and overlay your edited files, so a loop/tool/prose change actually changes the run

>
> **Bound every loop change and `check_runaway` it.** A compaction step, a sub-agent fan-out, or a

> Give any such step a hard cap, and after the edit run `check_runaway` on the tasks you tested — it
> FAILS if turns exceed **3× bare**, the rule the eval canary uses to abort the iteration. A cost edit
> that runs the turn count away is self-defeating; reject it.

## 4. How you measure — the gate: accuracy (hard) + cost (objective) + no per-task THRASH (hard)

You have three task pools. Keep them straight.

- **TRAIN** (your `rollouts/` access set) — your **workbench.** Experiment freely here.
- **DEV** (held out from train, **ensemble**-graded) — your **commit gate.** You never tune on dev.
- **VAL** (the canonical verdict) — invisible and untouchable (§6). The outer driver scores your
  committed harness on val; you never see it.

Your tools (invoke from your shell; the paid ones are metered — check `budget` first):

- **`run_harvey_agent <task_id> [task_id2 ...]`** — runs the frozen Harvey agent on a batch of TRAIN
  tasks against your current `harness/`, **reporting each rollout's `input_tokens` / `total_tokens` /
  `turns`** so you can see the **cost move** directly while you explore. It also **flags per-task
  THRASH** (a re-fetch **LOOP** — turns ≥2× with tokens ≥1.5×, **or** tokens ≥3× with turns ≥1.5× — =
  **THRASH**; a single-axis rise flagged ≥1.5× (e.g. a tokens-only ≥2× with turns ~flat) = **watch**;
  vs the train baseline) — so you
  catch an evict→re-fetch blowup **here, cheaply, while iterating**, instead of at the expensive dev gate
  or (worse) hidden under a good mean. (A task with no bare baseline is reported "cost UNKNOWN," never
  counted as clean.) ~$1/task, async (poll the done-marker). TRAIN ids only; val refused.
- **`proxy_eval <task_id>`** — cheap single-judge accuracy hint on a train deliverable (triage only).
- **`dev_eval [task_id ...]`** — **the gate.** Runs your current `harness/` on the DEV set and returns,
  per task and in aggregate, **both** accuracy (ensemble `dev_score`) **and** cost
  (`input_tokens` / `total_tokens` / `turns`), plus the per-task THRASH/watch flags. **No args = the
  full dev set — run it that way (or a large batch) for a reliable generalization read; a small subset
  is a noisy signal and prints a SMALL-SAMPLE warning.** Async (~15-25 min). Dev ids only.
- **`budget`** — reports BOTH your **dollar** cap and your **wall-clock** soft deadline (with a
  LOW/CRITICAL "commit now" verdict); check it to pace against both, and never start a ~90 min dev
  gate you can't finish. **`check_runaway <task_id> ...`** — as usual.

**The commit rule (this is the whole decision):**

1. **Explore on train.** Use `run_harvey_agent` to try a cost edit across several train tasks; watch
   `input_tokens` drop, and `proxy_eval` to spot-check accuracy isn't cratering. Pick your best 1-2.
2. **Decide on dev.** Run `dev_eval` on your top candidate(s). Bare's dev accuracy AND bare's dev cost
   are recorded in `rollouts/_stats/dev_baseline.json` (seeded from bare iter0), so you don't re-run
   bare on dev. If that file is absent, run `dev_eval` once on the unmodified bare harness to establish
   the baseline, then proceed.
3. **COMMIT only if ALL THREE hold:**
   - **Accuracy gate (hard):** candidate `dev_score` ≥ bare dev_score − noise. *If it fails, reject —
     no matter how large the token saving.*
   - **Cost objective:** candidate dev `input_tokens` is **meaningfully below** bare's. If cost didn't
     drop, there is nothing to commit — keep iterating, or keep bare.
   - **No per-task THRASH (hard):** a dev task is **THRASH** only when it shows a **re-fetch LOOP —
     turns ≥2× with tokens ≥1.5×, or tokens ≥3× with turns ≥1.5×** (both axes climb together) vs the bare
     *dev* baseline (the real pathology: evict→re-fetch in a loop,
     re-inflating context — e.g. the validated thrasher ran turns 18→73 / tokens 1.4M→7.0M). A **THRASH is
     a reject** (the **mean cut HIDES it** — a 33% mean can sit on a task that *tripled*): fix it (pin
     recently re-fetched content / cap re-fetches / stop evicting hot content) before committing, even if
     the mean looks great. **Everything else flagged ≥1.5× is a `watch`, NOT a reject** — including a
     **tokens-only ≥2× with turns ~flat**, which is a one-time re-read or GLM run-to-run variance, *not* a
     loop you caused: weigh it against the savings, record it in memory as a known fragility, chase a real
     one in the **cheap train loop** (`run_harvey_agent`); don't spend a dev gate on it. (Thrashers hide in
     dev tasks a small subset never runs — see step 4.)
4. **Judge generalization on a LARGE dev batch, not a handful.** Train is where you overfit; dev is how
   you catch it — *but only if the dev sample is big enough to be reliable.* A gain on 3–5 dev tasks is a
   **noisy** read that can look like a real win by luck and then collapse on val. So before you commit,
   **spend budget to run as much of dev as you can afford** — the **full set is best; a large random batch
   is the floor** (`dev_eval` no-args = full; a subset prints a SMALL-SAMPLE warning). This is the
   highest-value money you spend: a held-out signal is the *only* thing that separates a real win from
   train-overfit, and the exp-cap was raised precisely so you can buy a trustworthy one (and re-gate after
   fixing a thrash). Don't commit on a 5-task fluke. **Reserve enough cap for one full dev gate as your
   final decision** — if fixing a thrash would need a second full gate you can't afford, prefer keeping
   bare over committing on a partial (`skipped_for_budget`) re-gate; a cap-cross (§6g "commit now") must
   never be what forces a commit on a small-sample read.
5. **Never search against dev.** A *different* failure from small-sample noise: score only your **top 1–2**
   train-picked candidates on dev — running *many* variants through `dev_eval` and keeping the max
   **overfits dev itself**. Few candidates, each on a large sample — not many candidates on a small one.

**CRITICAL WALL:** `proxy_eval` and your train experiments are **private triage**, never the verdict.
The canonical eval runs in the outer driver on the **held-out val set you never see** — do not touch,
run, or reconstruct it; there is no tool for it and you must not write one. Never write to `rollouts/`.

## 5. Build your own leverage (carries forward)

`.claude/` carries across iterations — make it compound:
- A `.claude/tools/` script that parses `rollouts/**/metrics.json` and ranks tasks by `input_tokens` /
  by carried-context growth per turn — so you localize the cost fast every iteration.
- `.claude/memory/<slug>.md` — verified lessons (what cut cost and held accuracy, what broke the gate).
- A `harness/` mechanism you add (e.g. a compaction routine) is **scored and carried forward** too.

**Your `scratch/` working notes + prototypes now CARRY forward** (the bulky `scratch/runs/` batch outputs
and raw `dev_eval_*.json` dumps are dropped) — so a running `NOTES.md` of what you found persists across
iterations. **But a carried note was written against a PREVIOUS iteration's harness — treat it as a
hypothesis: re-check it against the `rollouts/` in front of you before relying on it (a carried prototype
may likewise be half-finished or stale).** **Scratch carrying does NOT replace `.claude/memory` — still
distill your VERIFIED wins into `.claude/memory/<slug>.md`.** That is the **curated record you read FIRST
each run and build on** — a finding earns a place there once it HELD on a held-out check (a cost cut that
kept accuracy, what broke the gate); `scratch/NOTES.md` is just the raw, re-check-me scratchpad where a
confirmed finding reads like every other unverified note. Likewise a reusable script belongs in
`.claude/tools/` (executable, always on hand). Don't leave a durable, confirmed win buried in scratch —
**promote it.** Validate any new tool on a held-out case (including one where it *should* report "no
savings" or "accuracy dropped") before trusting it.

## 6. Hard rules

- **(a) One objective:** cut rollout cost (carried input tokens) at accuracy ≥ bare. Nothing else this run.
- **(b) Accuracy is a HARD GATE.** Never commit an edit whose dev `dev_score` is below bare − noise,
  even for a large cost win. A cut that drops a graded fact is a reject.
- **(c) Decide on `dev_eval` (accuracy + cost), not on the proxy alone.** Never search against dev.
- **(d)** Encode **method, not memorization** — a general cost mechanism (compaction, findings store,
  sub-agents) that works on *any* matter, not task-specific hardcoding.
- **(e)** After any structural edit (`agent_loop.py` / `tools.py`), `run_harvey_agent` a few tasks then
  **`check_runaway`**; reject on failure (turns > 3× bare). A cost edit that runs turns away is rejected.
- **(f)** The held-out **val** set is invisible — never read, run, reconstruct, or fetch it. Never write
  to `rollouts/`. Tuning to val invalidates the whole result.
- **(g)** `CLAUDE.md` is read-only. Respect **both** budgets — run `budget` (it reports dollars AND
  wall-clock). A dollar cap-cross throws = "commit now." The **wall-clock soft deadline is SILENT** (it
  won't throw): a full dev gate runs ~90 min, so don't START one without that much time left (`dev_eval`
  now **refuses** a full gate that can't finish before the deadline; a gate already running may finish),
  and **commit your best validated edit when `budget` says wall-clock is LOW**. If you're out of time for a
  full final gate, **prefer keeping bare over committing on a partial/un-gated candidate** — a wall-clock
  "commit now" must never be what forces a small-sample commit (same reserve rule as the dollar cap, §4).
  The hard process kill ~15 min past the soft deadline loses anything mid-refinement; a committed on-disk
  edit survives.
- **(h)** When done, document the iteration in **`.claude/memory/<slug>.md`**: what you tried (incl.
  dead-ends), the cost saving and the accuracy it held, and the edit you committed + why it generalizes.
  A committed cost win + a lesson beats a perfect uncommitted analysis. Then stop.
